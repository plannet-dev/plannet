# Plannet Manifesto

## 👣 What Plannet Is

Plannet is a command-line tool for developers who do real work that rarely gets recorded.

It exists for the invisible operators–the senior ICs, leads, rescuers, and quiet fixers–who carry teams forward but often leave no artifacts behind. The ones who move faster than the tooling, solve problems others haven't fully diagnosed, and vanish before anyone files the ticket.

Plannet is **not** a task manager.

It doesn’t replace Jira, Linear, Trello, or Notion.

It’s the layer that lives *between* the work and the record.

It’s the trace.

The receipt.

The breadcrumb trail left behind by people doing high-leverage work–without ever needing to narrate it.

## 🧭 Why We Built This

We built Plannet because we were tired of lying in standup.

Because we were tired of forgetting what we fixed at 11pm on a Thursday.

Because we were tired of answering the question:

> “What did you actually work on last week?”

And because we knew–deep down–that if we didn’t leave our own trace, no system was going to do it for us.

We built this for the ones doing the un-tracked side quests.

For the ones whose names get spoken with reverence, but never show up in the sprint report.

For the ones who finish the thing that saves the project–and then forget they even did it.

## 💡 The Core Beliefs

These aren’t product features. They’re principles.

They shape every decision we make–and every one we say no to.

### 1. Flow Is Sacred
Anything that breaks your flow to “log something” is already failing.  
Plannet should feel ambient. Observational. Like a respectful assistant who quietly notices what you’re doing and writes it down for you–after the fact.

### 2. Unlogged Work Still Counts
Just because you didn’t open a ticket doesn’t mean it wasn’t real.  
Plannet respects the side quest. The quick fix. The ad hoc mentoring session.  
Invisible work is often the most valuable kind.

### 3. Ceremony Is Expensive
If the tool asks you to explain yourself, it’s already wrong.  
Plannet should never require overhead just to be useful.  
Setup should be one command. Usage should be instinctive. Logging should feel like capturing memory–not performing accountability.

### 4. Local First, Always
Your work is yours.  
Your data stays on your machine by default.  
If and when you choose to surface it–for a teammate, a manager, or a future-you–it’s because you decided to, not because we sent it anywhere.

### 5. Respect Over Reward
Plannet doesn’t exist to give you points, streaks, or gamified nonsense.  
It exists to give your work the dignity of visibility–without needing to perform.

## 🛠 Who We’re Building For

If you've ever:

- Written five commits on the wrong branch just to unblock a teammate
- Solved a production issue without touching a ticket
- Rewrote half a module while doing a "quick review"
- Lost track of what you did yesterday because none of it showed up in Jira
- Fixed something you weren’t assigned but couldn’t ignore

Then Plannet is for you.

We’re not building for middle managers.  
We’re not building for process junkies.  
We’re not even building for “teams”–not at first.

We’re building for the outliers:
The fast movers.
The rescue squad.
The builders who finish more work than they start.

## ✨ What It Feels Like (When It Works)

Plannet isn’t flashy.

It doesn’t brag.

When it works, it gives you a moment of quiet recognition:

> “Oh. That’s what I did today.”

A clear CLI output.
A gentle trace.
A record that feels like you, not a system forcing you into someone else’s taxonomy.

Plannet says:
You worked.
You finished.
You moved things forward.
Even if no one else saw it–you did.

---

## 📐 The Product Philosophy (In Practice)

### Plannet doesn't interrupt.
It listens. Observes. Assembles context from your real activity (git branches, commits, time blocks).

### Plannet doesn't track you.
It surfaces *what you’ve already done*. It doesn't judge it, rank it, or try to optimize it.

### Plannet doesn't report for you.
But it makes it easy to see your own history–and share it if you choose to.

## 🔧 Where We Refuse to Go

We will not:

❌ Become a dashboard-first tool  
❌ Push analytics for analytics’ sake  
❌ Write back to ticketing systems without your consent  
❌ Add integrations that slow things down  
❌ Become another “productivity” tool that shames you into doing more

---

## 🌱 Why We’re Still Building

The first build isn’t perfect. It’s intentionally small.

Right now, Plannet:

- Captures recent git activity and surfaces probable “sessions”
- Lets you manually log moments you want to remember
- Helps you reflect on what actually happened
- Stores everything locally

It doesn’t:

- Integrate with Jira (yet)
- Push to the cloud
- Have team dashboards
- Replace your PM’s workflow

We’re not chasing features.  
We’re chasing resonance.  
We’re trying to find the moment where someone sees the output and says:

> “Holy shit. This tool gets how I work.”

---

## 📣 The Call

We’re looking for early testers.

Not to validate vanity metrics.
Not to inflate user counts.

We’re looking for people who:

- Move fast
- Hate logging
- Ship often
- Remember nothing

If you’ve ever said “I forgot what I did this week”  
Plannet might be for you.

Try it.
Tell us what felt right.
Tell us what broke.
Tell us where it made you feel like your work finally had a witness.

## 🚀 The Tagline

> **No more un-tracked side quests.**

That’s what this is about.  
Not productivity. Not measurement. Not KPIs.

Just work.
Real work.
Remembered.
