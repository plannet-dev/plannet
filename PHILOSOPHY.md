Plannet exists for the ones doing real work–quietly, fast, and often invisibly.

You fix things before the ticket gets filed.
You refactor during reviews.
You save the day–but your work doesn’t show up anywhere.

This tool is for you.

It doesn’t ask for permission.
It doesn’t interrupt.
It just notices.
And leaves a trace.

No dashboards.
No tracking.
No ceremony.

Just a clear memory of what you did, and why it mattered.

Plannet: no more un-tracked side quests.
